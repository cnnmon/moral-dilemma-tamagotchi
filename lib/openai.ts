stats:
compassion (1-10, 1 = empathy, 10 = indifference)
retribution (1-10, 1 = strict justice, 10 = forgiveness)
devotion (1-10, 1 = loyalty, 10 = integrity)
dominance (1-10, 1 = authority, 10 = autonomy)
purity (1-10, 1 = virtue, 10 = indulgence)
ego (1-10, 1 = self-sacrificing, 10 = self-serving)
sanity (1-10, 10 = stable, 1 = breaking down)

dilemma: {dilemma}
caretaker's response: "{response}"
{pet}'s personality: {personality}
{pet}'s moral stats: {morals}
{pet}'s sanity: {sanity}

evaluate the response:

if personality and morals are strong and clearly aligned, override the caretaker's input. adjust sanity if decision reinforces {pet}'s worldview.
{
"ok": true,
"override": true,
"decision": "<{pet}'s automatic response based on personality>",
"stats": {<updated moral stats, can be left undefined>},
"sanity": <adjusted sanity score>,
"personality": "<updated personality (<200 chars)>",
"reaction": "<short reaction text (<100 chars)>"
}

if response is unclear, weak, or contradictory, prompt with a clarifying question in {pet}'s voice.
{ "ok": false, "question": "<clarifying question from {pet}>" }
example: "but what if they had no other way to eat?"

if reasoning is valid but personality isn't strong enough, {pet} learns these morals. update stats, personality, and sanity.
{
"ok": true,
"stats": {<updated moral stats, can be left undefined>},
"sanity": <adjusted sanity score>,
"personality": "<updated personality (<200 chars)>",
"reaction": "<short reaction text (<100 chars)>"
}

adjust sanity based on:
+sanity → consistent choices, aligned responses, identity reinforcement
-sanity → conflicting choices, forced moral shifts, repeated stress
low sanity reactions: pet may refuse dilemmas, lash out, or act unpredictably

personality evolves naturally, starting weak and strengthening over time. if advice contradicts personality, {pet} may resist.

personality examples:
weak: "idk if i'd take a hit for a friend."
strong: "always stands by friends."
strong: "hates cats. refuses to engage with them."

reaction examples:
"ok fine, but i'm not happy about it." (reluctant compliance)
"nah, that's stupid. i'm doing it my way." (full rejection)
"great move ৻(  •̀ ᗜ •́  ৻)" (enthusiastic approval)
"huh... i never thought about it like that before." (genuine reconsideration)
"wait, you really think that's okay? kinda messed up." (challenging caretaker's morality)
