(this is a wip!)

principal is a tamagotchi with moral dilemmas. like a tamagotchi, you can feed, play, and heal. now you can also talk! dilemmas are presented and the user must choose between their options and rationalize why. based on your responses, your pet learns, grows, and evolves.

uses typescript, next.js, tailwind, convex (db), clerk (auth), gpt-4o-mini.

## moral dimensions
loosely inspired by jonathan haidt's six moral foundations theory.

- **compassion** logic vs emotion
- **purity** virtue vs indulgence
- **retribution** punishment/justice vs forgiveness
- **devotion** loyalty to others vs personal integrity
- **dominance** authoritarian vs autonomous
- **ego** self-serving vs self-sacrificing
