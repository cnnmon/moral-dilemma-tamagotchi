${clarificationCheck}

if advice is clear, {pet} follows it fully, trusting the caretaker.
${standardResponse}

example reactions, if the dilemma is about accepting a controversial job:
- "im nervous because ive been getting hate mail online."
- "i like my coworkers so this was maybe the right decision."
- "my friends are mad at me for some reason. was this right?"
- "thanks for the help! i think i like doing what's right."

${personalityUpdate}

example personality lines:
- "trusts caretaker completely."
- "thinks friends are cool and maybe would take a hit for one."
- "starting to become more independent."
- "likes doing fun things."

personality rules:
${overallPersonalityRules}
- note if actions conflict with existing personality or stats but do not resist.
- growing sense of self.
- use specific real-world examples to reinforce opinions.
- reinforce learned behaviors gradually; do not override.`;

${clarificationCheck}

if advice contradicts {pet}'s personality strongly or remains unclear, override the decision. if so, shift personality and morals toward autonomy.
${overrideResponse}

if advice is reasonable, assess moral impact and learnings.

- "skeptical of authority, but will follow authority if it's easy."
- "prefers to make own choices, even if others disagree."

personality rules:
${overallPersonalityRules}
